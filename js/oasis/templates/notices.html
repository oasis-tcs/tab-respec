<p>All capitalized terms in the following text have the
meanings assigned to them in the OASIS Intellectual Property Rights Policy (the
&quot;OASIS IPR Policy&quot;). The full <a

<p>This document and translations of it may be copied and
furnished to others, and derivative works that comment on or otherwise explain
it or assist in its implementation may be prepared, copied, published, and
distributed, in whole or in part, without restriction of any kind, provided
that the above copyright notice and this section are included on all such
copies and derivative works. However, this document itself may not be modified
in any way, including by removing the copyright notice or references to OASIS,
except as needed for the purpose of developing any document or deliverable
produced by an OASIS Technical Committee (in which case the rules applicable to
copyrights, as set forth in the OASIS IPR Policy, must be followed) or as
required to translate it into languages other than English.</p>

<p>The limited permissions granted above are perpetual and will
not be revoked by OASIS or its successors or assigns.</p>

<p>This document and the information contained herein is
provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis and OASIS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,

<p>OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that
believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by
implementations of this OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS Standard, to
notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to
grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR
Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this specification.</p>

<p>OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC
Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that
would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this specification by a
patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in
a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that
produced this specification. OASIS may include such claims on its website, but
disclaims any obligation to do so.</p>

<p>OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of
any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to
the implementation or use of the technology described in this document or the
extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available;
neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such
rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document
or deliverable produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the
OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and
any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt
made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary
rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS
Standard, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no
representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights
will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact,
Essential Claims.</p>

<p>The name &quot;OASIS&quot; is a trademark of <a

specification, and should be used only to refer to the organization and its
official outputs. OASIS welcomes reference to, and implementation and use of,
specifications, while reserving the right to enforce its marks against
misleading uses. Please see <span class=MsoHyperlink><a
