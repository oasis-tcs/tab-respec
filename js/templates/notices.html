       OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims
       that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Project Specification
       or OASIS Standard, to notify the OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its
       willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the
       IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this specification.
     </p>
     <p>
       OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership
       of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this specification
       by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner
       consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Open Project that produced this specification.
       OASIS may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
       OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property
       or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of
       the technology described in this document or the extent to which any license under
       such rights might or might not be available;
       neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights.
       Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable
       produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS website.
       Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses
       to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license
       or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this
       OASIS Open Project Specification or OASIS Standard, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator.
       OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights
       will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.
