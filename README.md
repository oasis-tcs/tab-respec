<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this repository is to support development and maintenance of extensions to the ReSpec application to enable it to produce OASIS-styled specifications. The original work was done by Nicholas Crossley of the OSLC Core TC.</p>

<p>The TAB itself is not formally an OASIS Technical Committee, but a working group chartered by the OASIS Board to provide technical assistance to OASIS. The TAB supports this work as part of its mission to improve the standards development process and the quality of OASIS Standards.</p>
