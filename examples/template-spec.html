  <p>This is the <em>abstract</em> for your specification.
    It should be fairly short...a couple of sentences.</p>
</section>
<section id='toc'></section>
<hr />
<section id='sotd'></section>
<section id='intro' class='informative'>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><em>A simple introduction. It would be good if the reader ended the
    introduction knowing what the spec does, ideally including a simple key example.</em></p>
<section id='conventions'></section>
<section class='informative'>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p><em>Call out some key problems, use cases, scenarios that have
    motivated this specification. References are good, especially to
    some Use Cases and Requirements.</em></p>
</section>
<section id='terminology' class='informative'>
  <h3>Terminology</h3>
  <p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]],
    W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]],
    W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],
    and Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
  <dl class="spaced">
    <dt><dfn>Term</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Defined of term. Simple one liners are better than full paragraphs.
      Save elaboration for the spec body.</dd>
  </dl>
</section>
<section id='concepts' class='informative'>
  <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
  <p><em>Optional section, though could be useful if intro can't cover it
    and you have enough concepts that it is worth elaborating on.
    A reasonable example is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#basic-concepts">JSON-LD Syntax spec</a>.</em></p>

  <h2>RDF Namespaces</h2>
  <p><em>Describe here any RDF namespaces defined by this standard, and their recommended prefixes.

  <h2>Conformance</h2>
  <section id='conformance-other'>
    <h3>Conformance to other standards</h3>
    <p>OSLC XXX servers MUST conform to [[!OSLCCore2]], and SHOULD conform to [[!OSLCCore3]] (and hence [[!LDP]]).</p>

    <p>The following table summarizes the conformance requirements for OSLC XXX.</p>
    <!-- ReSpec will insert a conformance clause table here -->
    </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Capability</h2>
  <p><em>The title of this section is flexible.  Since the title of this spec should match what it does, it
    may not make sense to repeat it here.  This section is intended to capture the conformance clauses
    (ie, the 'meat' of the spec).</em></p>
  <section id="clause">
    <h2>Clause section</h2>
    <p><em>Give your section title/id something meaningful and simple, don't include the actual section number.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Writing conformance clauses/statements: </strong> Create individual sections for each conformance clause.
      Each clause should cleanly map to a test case, see [[LDP]] spec and <a href="http://w3c.github.io/ldp-testsuite">LDP testsuite</a> for an example of this model.</em></p>
    <section id="clausea">
      <p class="conformance" strength="MUST, SHOULD" title="Use appropriate [[RFC2116]] keywords">OSLC specifications MUST provide [[RFC2116]] keywords that SHOULD be in ALL CAPS and MAY include client and/or server needs.</p>

    <h2>Shape</h2>
    <p><em>For every resource that is defined, define a shape for it.
      You may have additional shapes for certain scenarios.
      Shapes are published separately as Turtle files;
      you may have one shape per Turtle source file, or put several related shapes in one file;
      either way, you must have one data-include for each shape, using the right anchor URL.</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p><em>This section details how OSLC clients can discover this capability.  It should follow the model
      set by [[LDP]] and [[OSLCCore3]].  Depending on the capability, it could be defined using existing
      HTTP headers, HTTP OPTIONS response, content in responses such as a predicate that links a ldp:Container
      to some other kinds of resource (such as type URL or shape), and so on.</em></p>
  </section>
</section>
<section class='appendix'>
  <h2>RDF Vocabulary</h2>
  <p><em>Each specification may define new vocabulary terms.
    These should be defined with consideration for global use (not within a specific type of resource).
    Other domains and resource types will be encouraged to reuse these.</em></p>
  <div title='RDF Vocabulary for Template'
